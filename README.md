# DeFi(Empire)

## Introduction

The "DeFi(Empire)" project introduces an ERC20 token, "HIRAL JR" (HJ), and a Vault contract. HJ adheres to the ERC20 standard for decentralized transactions, featuring total supply tracking, balance management, and events for transfers and approvals. The Vault contract, interacting with HJ through the IERC20 interface, provides a secure platform for users to deposit and withdraw funds, earning shares proportional to their contributions. This forms the basis for secure and transparent decentralized finance activities within the DeFi(Empire) project, enabling users to engage in efficient financial transactions on the blockchain.
